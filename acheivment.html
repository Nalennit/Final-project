            <h1>The Defeat of Yone</h1>
            <p class="text">
              Back when i was starting to get to know the game(League of
              Legends), there was a certain character you could play who was
              extremely low-skill-required and cosidered the strongest most
              broken character at that time. Meaning that if you were playing
              against an enemy player who was Yone, you were in for a hopelessly
              gruesome 30+ minutes of getting killed over and over as he gets
              stronger and you get weaker. But eventually i beat him, that in it
              of itself to me, is an acheivment. This was also during the time
              when "Lethal Tempo", a very strong sort of amplifier for the
              character's stats was still existent in the game.

                I used to study in Yukunthor international school which
                specializes in computer sciences and technology. We had a very
                special school project once that was gonna be showcased in a
                public school convention, to win the best presentation/product
                award, me and my team decided on an insanely crazy idea to win
                the gold medal and 500K riel check. We were gonna plan and piece
                together an entire layout to design a fully funtional PC, we
                gathered parts from individual computer stores, bought many
                components such as brand new RAM and CPU drives from the
                internet and successfully constructed the entire thing.
